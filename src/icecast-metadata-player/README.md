# Icecast Metadata Player

Icecast Metadata Player is browser library that plays streaming audio with full cross-platform codec support and real-time metadata updates.

  * Plays streaming audio using [Media Source Extensions API](https://github.com/eshaz/mse-audio-wrapper), [Web Assembly audio decoders](https://github.com/eshaz/wasm-audio-decoders), and HTML5 audio.
  * Provides synchronized ICY metadata and Ogg metadata updates.
  * Seamless playback during network changes (i.e. Wifi to Cell network).
  * Seamlessly switch between endpoints during playback (i.e. moving between load balanced streams, or streams with different codecs).
  * Lazy loading of dependencies for faster and more efficient load times.
  * Available as an [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icecast-metadata-player) and as a file to include in a `<script>` tag.
    * See [Installing](#installing)

## Usage

* To use `IcecastMetadataPlayer`, create a new instance by passing in the stream endpoint, and the options object (optional). See the [Options](#options) and [Callbacks](#callback) sections for more information.

   ```javascript
   const player = new IcecastMetadataPlayer("https://stream.example.com", {
     onMetadata: (metadata) => {console.log(metadata)},
     ...options
   })
   ```
  IcecastMetadataPlayer supports reading ICY metadata, Ogg (Vorbis Comment) metadata, or both. Each section below describes how to instantiate `IcecastMetadataPlayer` to use these different metadata types.

  ### ICY Metadata

  * When reading ICY metadata, the client should be able to read the `Icy-MetaInt` header value on the response. If the CORS policy does not allow clients to read the `Icy-MetaInt` header, then `IcecastMetadataPlayer` will attempt to detect the metadata interval based on the incoming request data.

    ```javascript
    const player = new IcecastMetadataPlayer("https://stream.example.com/stream.mp3", {
      onMetadata: (metadata) => {console.log(metadata)},
      metadataTypes: ["icy"]
      ...options
    })
    ```

  ### Ogg Metadata

  * Ogg (Vorbis Comment) metadata, if available, usually offers more detail than ICY metadata.

    ```javascript
    const player = new IcecastMetadataPlayer("https://stream.example.com/stream.opus", {
      onMetadata: (metadata) => {console.log(metadata)},
      metadataTypes: ["ogg"]
      ...options
    })
    ```

  ### ICY and Ogg Metadata

  * ICY and Ogg metadata can both be read from the stream. Usually a stream will only have one or the other, but this option is possible if needed.

    ```javascript
    const player = new IcecastMetadataPlayer("https://stream.example.com/stream.flac", {
      onMetadata: (metadata) => {console.log(metadata)},
      metadataTypes: ["icy", "ogg"]
      ...options
    })
    ```

### Playing a Stream

1. To begin playing a stream, call the `.play()` method on the instance.

    *Note:* IcecastMetadataPlayer will use either the MediaSource api or, if that is not available, HTML5 audio with a second request for metadata.

    ```javascript
    const player = new IcecastMetadataPlayer("https://stream.example.com/stream.flac", {
      onMetadata: (metadata) => {console.log(metadata)},
      metadataTypes: ["icy"]
      ...options
    })

    player.play();
    ```

1. Metadata will be sent as soon as it is discovered via the `onMetadataEnqueue` callback and when the metadata is synchronized with the audio via the `onMetadata` callback. See the [Methods](#methods) section below for additional callbacks.
    
    #### Metadata
    ```javascript
    { 
      StreamTitle: "The stream's title", // ICY
      StreamUrl: "The stream's url", //     ICY
      TITLE: "The stream's title", //       Ogg
      ARTIST: "The stream's artist", //     Ogg
      ALBUM: "The stream's album" //        Ogg
    }
    ```

1. To stop playing the stream, call the `stop()` method on the instance.

    ```javascript
    player.stop();
    ```

See the [HTML demos](https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js/tree/master/src/demo/public/html-demos/) for examples.

## Reconnecting

IcecastMetadataPlayer enables retry / reconnect logic by default. When a fetch or network error occurs, IcecastMetadataPlayer will attempt to recover by retrying the fetch request.

This allows for seamless audio playback when switching networks, (i.e. from a cell network to a Wifi network).

See [Retry Options](#Retry-Options) to configure or disable reconnects. 

### Reconnect Lifecycle:

1. The `error` / `onError` event will be fired indicating the issue that caused the retry process to start.
1. IcecastMetadataPlayer will try to fetch the next stream endpoint periodically using an exponential back-off strategy configurable in the `options` object.
   * Each retry attempt will select the next stream endpoint when a list of stream endpoints are provided. These may be selected in the order they are provided, or in random order. See [options.endpointOrder](#options).
   * Each retry attempt will fire a `retry` / `onRetry` event.
1. Retries will stop when either of the below conditions are met:
   * The fetch request succeeds.
   * The audio element is paused / `stop()` is called.
   * The audio element buffer is empty **and** the retry timeout is met.
1. When the retry is successful, a `streamstart` / `onStreamStart` event will be fired and the audio will restart playing from the new request.
   * When using the MediaSource API, the old and new request will be synchronized together on a frame basis for seamless playback.
1. When the retry times out, a `retrytimeout` / `onRetryTimeout` event will be fired and the stream will stop.

### Seamless audio playback:

The audio will continue to play until the buffer runs out while reconnecting. If the reconnect is successful before the buffer runs out, there will be no gap in playback.

To increase the amount of audio that is buffered by clients, increase the `<burst-size>` setting in your Icecast server.

## Switching Endpoints

IcecastMetadataPlayer enables the stream endpoint to be switched during playback to any new endpoint by calling `switchEndpoint`.

The next endpoint will fetched and attempted to be synchronized with playback from the previous endpoint. The next endpoint is selected from either from the current list of endpoints, or the new passed in list. The transition from the old to new stream should be seamless using synchronization logic that first attempts to match the frame data exactly using CRC32 hashes, and if there is no exact match, by synchronizing the PCM streams using cross-correlation.

### `switchEndpoint` lifecycle

1. The old endpoint network request is aborted; however, any buffered audio will continue to play.
1. The new endpoint network request is started.
1. Playback will attempt to be synchronized with the next endpoint audio using two methods:
   * **CRC Syncing** If the data is an exact match between the old and new endpoints, the stream will be synchronized using CRC32 hashes of each codec frame and playback will continue seamlessly from the new endpoint.
     * See [codec-parser](https://github.com/eshaz/codec-parser) for the library that enables CRC syncing.
   * **PCM Syncing** If the data does not match, both the old and new audio data will be decoded to PCM and synchronized using a correlation algorithm. The correlation coefficient (-100% worst to 100% best) will be printed to the console if `enableLogging` is set to `true`.
     * See [synaudio](https://github.com/eshaz/synaudio) for the library that enables PCM syncing.
1. Once the new stream is synchronized, playback will begin from the new stream.
   * If the buffered audio runs out during synchronization, the new stream will begin to play immediately to prevent any gaps in playback.

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging

#### Source Map

IcecastMetadataPlayer builds are supplied with a source map, which allows the minified code to be viewed as fully formatted code in a browser debugger.
* To enable the source map, simply copy `icecast-metadata-player-1.17.1.min.js.map` located in the build folder of this project to the location along side `icecast-metadata-player-1.17.1.min.js` in your website.
* The source map can be used to step through and debug the code as well as see the full variable names and file origin on stack traces if you are facing any issues.

### Common Issues

> ICY Metadata has incorrect characters such as "Zanzibar - Sz�lj M�r" when it should be "Zanzibar - Szólj Már"

* Try setting the `icyCharacterEncoding` option to match the character encoding of the metadata.
* A common ICY metadtata encoding other than `utf-8` is `iso-8859-2`

> I have an authenticated stream, and when I supply credentials in the `authentication` option, I get a CORS error.

* Ensure your Icecast server or your proxy has `Authorization` listed in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header when it responses to the CORS `OPTIONS` request.
* Example: `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, Icy-MetaData, Range, Authorization`

### Warning messages

*Note: Warning messages are be enabled by setting `options.enableLogging = true`*

> Reconnected successfully after retry event. Found 145 frames (3.788 seconds) of overlapping audio data in new request. Synchronized old and new request.

* The stream successfully reconnected after a disconnect, and the old request was synchronized with the new request for seamless playback.
* This usually happens when switching networks, or if there was a brief interruption in your internet connection. (i.e. cell to WiFi, WiFi to ethernet, temporary loss of cell connection, etc.)

> Reconnected successfully after retry event. Found no overlapping frames from previous request. Unable to sync old and new request.

* The stream successfully reconnected after a disconnect, but there wasn't enough data in the buffer to synchronize the old request with new request.
* If this happens frequently, try increasing the [`burst-size` option](https://www.icecast.org/docs/icecast-trunk/config_file/#limits) (or equivalent) in your Icecast configuration to increase the client's buffered data.

> Passed in Icy-MetaInt is invalid. Attempting to detect ICY Metadata.

* The stream has been requested with ICY metadata, but the server did not respond with the `Icy-MetaInt` header. `IcecastMetadataPlayer` will attempt to detect the ICY metadata interval, and will timeout after a default of 2 seconds, or the value in milliseconds passed into the `icyDetectionTimeout` option.
* If your stream contains ICY metadata, and it is not detected, audio errors will occur. Increase the detection timeout to search longer for ICY metadata.
* This warning could also be displayed if the stream was requested with ICY metadata, but it does not contain ICY metadata. In this case, the ICY detection will timeout and the stream will play without ICY metadata. Please update your code to no longer request ICY metadata.

> This stream is not an Ogg stream. No Ogg metadata will be returned.

* IcecastMetadataPlayer has `"ogg"` passed into the `metadataTypes` options, but the stream response is not an ogg stream. ICY metadata and the stream will work without issues. Please remove the `"ogg"` option to remove this warning.

### Error messages

> This stream was requested with ICY metadata. If there is a CORS preflight failure, try removing "icy" from the metadataTypes option.

* A network error occurred while requesting the stream with the `Icy-MetaData: 1` header.
  * IcecastMetadataPlayer will attempt to retry the request using the retry configuration.
  * It's possible that this was caused by the Icecast server's CORS policy not allowing the `Icy-Metadata` header. If you want ICY metadata, your CORS policy must allow this header to be requested. See [CORS Troubleshooting](https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js#cors) for more information.
  * Additionally, attempting to access a HTTP from a HTTPS origin will be blocked by modern browsers

> Your browser does not support this audio codec *mime-type*

> Unsupported Codec *mime-type*

* No playback methods are able to play the audio codec being streamed from the Icecast stream. Check the URL that was passed in. If the URL is correct, this stream cannot be played on your browser.

> The audio element encountered an error

* An error occurred while the browser was playing or decoding the audio. This may occur if your browser doesn't support a codec or if there is a problem with the Icecast stream.

> NotAllowedError: The play method is not allowed by the user agent or the platform in the current context, possibly because the user denied permission.

> NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first. https://goo.gl/xX8pDD

* This error occurs when attempting to call `play()` without it being triggered by a user interaction on the web page. See [#107](https://github.com/eshaz/icecast-metadata-js/issues/107) and this [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide) for more information.
